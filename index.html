            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Review of Application & Supporting Documents</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Did anyone help you prepare your asylum application?</strong>
                No, I did it by myself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Is everything in your application true and correct to the best of your knowledge?</strong>
                Yes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Are there any changes to make?</strong>
                No.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Did anyone help you prepare your personal statement or your supporting documents?</strong>
                No, I did that by myself too.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How did you obtain those support letters?</strong>
                I emailed them and asked. Two mailed the letters, one emailed because she was too scared to mail it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Are all supporting documents true and correct?</strong>
                Yes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Any medical conditions affecting memory?</strong>
                No.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Have you lied to the US government or officials?</strong>
                Yes. On my US visa application, I lied and said I was not arrested/detained.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Why did you lie?</strong>
                I was afraid that listing my arrest would mean no visa and being stuck. They had threatened me, and I was trying to escape.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Did you lie about anything else on your visa application?</strong>
                No, everything else was true.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Was everything in the visa interview true?</strong>
                Yes.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Personal Story: Basis for Asylum</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Why are you applying for asylum?</strong>
                I'm afraid to return to my country because I fear being arrested, detained, tortured, and even killed by the authorities because of my political activities against the ruling party.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Were you ever physically harmed or threatened? How many times?</strong>
                I was physically harmed five times. I don't know exactly how many times I was threatened, but at least 10.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>When did these five incidents occur?</strong>
                First time: February 3rd; detained for 8 days, beaten on Feb 4th, 5th, 9th; last time: March 15—all last year.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Were you physically harmed after March 15?</strong>
                No.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Describe in detail what happened the first time.</strong>
                Attending opposition party meeting, police burst in, shouting. Leader accused us of anti-government activities, we were handcuffed, I was beaten and separated for defending a colleague, taken to police station in different car.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Can you explain in detail about the ride from your friend's house to the police station?</strong>
                I was in pain, afraid I had a concussion. Handcuffed in back seat, officers in front, bumpy ride, didn't know destination, tried asking, got yelled at. Drive was over an hour, then arrived at unfamiliar police station.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Where was the jail cell?</strong>
                Ground floor in the back of police station.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Were you in the same cell all 8 days?</strong>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Please describe the jail cell.</strong>
                All by myself, very small—less than half the size of this office. Hard concrete floor, slept with rolled-up shirt as pillow, very hot, no windows, flickering light, bucket used as toilet, never emptied, many flies, dirty smell, one wall of metal bars at the door.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Were you taken out for interrogation?</strong>
                Yes, three times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Describe the interrogation room.</strong>
                Bigger than cell. Police at metal desk, folder with papers, metal chair, two officers in corner, bright lights, no windows.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What happened during first interrogation?</strong>
                Asked to give names of opposition members, funding, methods. I replied I didn't know anything, said it was my first meeting; they called me liar and beat me.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How did they beat you?</strong>
                Pulled hair, slapped face, strapped arms to chair, beat me with rubber batons—on both arms, legs, stomach, sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How long did it last?</strong>
                Several minutes, felt like forever. More pain when I cried out.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What did they say while beating you?</strong>
                Called me a traitor, said they'd make me talk, threatened me.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Were you beaten during the other interrogations?</strong>
                Yes, beatings were similar but more painful due to bruises. Third time they poured cold water over my face, felt like drowning, could hardly breathe.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Life in Detention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>How did you spend your time in detention?</strong>
                Time moved slowly; pain from beatings, covered in bruises, cell got more filthy, never allowed to shower or change clothes, slept on hard floor with rolled shirt as pillow, only fed once a day—bad food with bugs, one bottle of water to last all day, mostly just thinking and worrying alone.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Why were you finally released?</strong>
                Don't know, just taken out of cell and released without explanation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Did they have you sign documents before release?</strong>

            <li>
                <strong>Did they say anything when you were released?</strong>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Did you seek medical attention?</strong>

        </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Any other encounters with authorities?</strong>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What did you do at protest?</strong>
                Passed out pamphlets, spoke to protesters, led chants, protested peacefully for democracy and against abuses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Did protest become violent?</strong>

            <li>
                <strong>Were you harmed at protest?</strong>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>When did you apply for US visa?</strong>
                Second week of February, granted in the first week of March.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Why not leave earlier when visa granted?</strong>

                <strong>Any problems leaving?</strong>

            <li>
                <strong>Could you live safely elsewhere in your country?</strong>
                Definitely not. Authorities share information across country; nowhere is safe, would have to live in hiding.
